                                                I am a working professional currently working with ECS Infosolutions Pvt. Ltd as an AWS Solutions Architect, currently studying for the Associate Developer. I got my graduation in Computer Science from 
                                                DY Patil's Ramrao Adik Institue of Technology, Nerul, Navi Mumbai . Being a computer science grad my expertise lie in related domains of Web Development, DevOps and Data Science. Machine Learning and AI excite me, gets me thinking as I love me a challenge. By best-friends are Stack Overflow, GitHub, reddit and Quora.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                Now with the boring stuff aside, I write, I sketch also I would love to be able to sing but that's just pushing my luck too much. I am someone who loves to learn, "wait, where else have I heard that?".
                                                Yeah right! Everywhere :p. As of when I'm writing this I'm learning to play a Ukulele, learning French, improving my oratory skills. Soon I'll be writing a blog ( "Soon" I hope ðŸ¤ž ).
